<h1>MicroJam 2020</h1>
Get ready for our upcoming event [Microjam](/microjam/en/)!

<h4 class="highlight">What is a game jam?</h4>

A game jam is an event where programmers, artists and gamers come together to create games; both computer games and board games.
At our game jam there is a 48 hours time limit and a randomized theme for inspiration.
Visit our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/liugamejam/) or follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/LiuGameJam) for upcoming events!

There is free breakfast on Saturday and Sunday. Fruits, snacks, and hot drinks are available for free during the event. If you bring your own food, there are fridges and microwaves available.
