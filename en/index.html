<h1>Who are we?</h1>

<p>LiTHe kod is a student association at Linköping University whose mission
is to promote and inspire the interest for programming,
software engineering and everything related.</p>

<p>We were founded in the fall of 2013 to organize code meetups where students
could meet, talk and help each other with everything code related.  We have
since continued to develop and we now arrange several types of activities such
as study visits, workshops, lectures, Game Jams, programming competitions and of
course code meetups every Tuesday at 5 pm. <a
href="http://lithehack.se/">Lithehack</a>, usually located on Campus Norrköping,
can for the time being be found online for more "traditional" coding help (kodstugor).</p>

<p>During the Corona pandemic we got ourselves our very own Discord server. Stop by
and say hi! We've now returned to campus meetups but if the world situation
changes drastically we'll go back to Discord.</p>

        <p>
            At 5pm every Tuesday we meet in Café Java to discuss everything
            related to programming. We hope to continue to meet on campus during
            the fall.
